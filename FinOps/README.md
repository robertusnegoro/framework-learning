## Overview

FinOps (Financial Operations) is a practice that brings financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud, enabling teams to make business trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality.

---

## What is FinOps?

FinOps is a **cultural practice** and **operating model** that brings together:
- **Finance**
- **Technology**
- **Business**

To manage cloud costs effectively and make data-driven spending decisions.

### Key Characteristics

- **Cultural Practice:** Requires cultural change, not just tools
- **Collaborative:** Cross-functional teams working together
- **Data-Driven:** Decisions based on data and metrics
- **Continuous:** Ongoing practice, not a one-time project
- **Cloud-Focused:** Primarily for cloud spending

---

## FinOps Principles

### 1. Teams Need to Take Ownership

Teams that use cloud resources should take ownership of their cloud costs.

### 2. A Centralized Team Drives Best Practices

A centralized FinOps team drives best practices and enables teams.

### 3. Everyone Takes Ownership of Their Cloud Usage

Everyone is responsible for their cloud usage and costs.

### 4. FinOps Reports Should Be Accessible and Timely

Reports should be accessible to everyone and provided in a timely manner.

### 5. Decisions Are Driven by Business Value of Cloud

Decisions should be driven by the business value of cloud, not just cost.

### 6. Take Advantage of the Variable Cost Model of Cloud

Leverage the variable cost model of cloud to optimize spending.
