## Depreciation

### Depreciation Methods

#### 1. Straight-Line Depreciation

**Method:** Depreciate asset evenly over useful life.

**Calculation:**

- Equal depreciation each period
- Simple and common

**Use Cases:**
- Standard assets
- Predictable usage
- Simple accounting

#### 2. Accelerated Depreciation

**Method:** Depreciate more in early years.

**Types:**

- Accelerated methods

**Use Cases:**
- Assets with rapid value loss
- Tax optimization
- Technology assets

#### 3. Units of Production

**Method:** Depreciate based on usage.

**Calculation:**
- (Cost - Salvage Value) / Total Units × Units Used
- Based on actual usage
- Usage-driven

**Use Cases:**
- Usage-based assets
- Variable usage
- Production assets

### Depreciation Best Practices

- **Consistent Method:** Use consistent method
- **Accurate Life:** Estimate useful life accurately
