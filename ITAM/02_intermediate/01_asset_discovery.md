## Overview

Asset discovery is the process of identifying and cataloging IT assets in an organization. Effective discovery is the foundation of ITAM, providing the data needed for inventory management, compliance, and cost optimization.

---

## Discovery Methods

### 1. Automated Discovery

**Definition:** Using tools and technologies to automatically identify and catalog IT assets.

**Advantages:**
- Fast and efficient
- Reduces manual effort
- Improves accuracy
- Scales with organization
- Real-time updates

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires tools and infrastructure
- May miss some assets
- Requires maintenance
- Initial setup complexity

### 2. Manual Discovery

**Definition:** The process of manually identifying and cataloging IT assets.

**Advantages:**
- No tool requirements
- Can find hidden assets
- Verifies automated data
- Good for small environments

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming
- Prone to errors
- Doesn't scale well
- Requires ongoing effort

### 3. Hybrid Approach

**Definition:** Combining automated and manual discovery methods.

**Advantages:**
- Best of both methods
- Improved accuracy
- Comprehensive coverage
- Validates automated data

**Best Practice:** Use automated discovery as primary method, manual for validation and edge cases.

## Manual Discovery Processes

### Physical Inventory

**Process:**
1. Plan inventory schedule
2. Visit locations
3. Identify assets
4. Record asset details
5. Update database

**Information to Collect:**
- Asset tag/serial number
- Location
- Owner/user
- Configuration details
- Condition

**Best Practices:**
- Use mobile devices for recording
- Take photos
- Verify against database
- Update immediately

### Documentation Review

**Process:**
1. Review purchase records
2. Review contracts
3. Review invoices
4. Review deployment records
5. Cross-reference with inventory

**Sources:**
- Purchase orders
- Contracts
- Invoices
- Deployment documentation
- Financial records

### Interviews and Surveys

**Process:**
1. Identify stakeholders
2. Prepare questions
3. Conduct interviews
4. Send surveys
5. Compile results

**Questions to Ask:**
- What assets do you use?
- Where are assets located?
- Who owns assets?
- What software is installed?
- Are there undocumented assets?
