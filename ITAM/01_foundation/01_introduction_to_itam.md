## ITAM vs ITIL Configuration Management

### Similarities

- Both track IT components
- Both maintain databases (CMDB/Asset Database)
- Both support IT operations
- Both require discovery processes

### Differences

| Aspect | ITAM | ITIL Configuration Management |
|--------|------|------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Financial and lifecycle | Service delivery |
| **Scope** | All IT assets | Service-related CIs |
| **Main Goal** | Cost optimization, compliance | Service support |
| **Lifecycle** | Plan → Acquire → Deploy → Manage → Retire | Service lifecycle |
| **Financial Tracking** | Strong focus | Limited focus |
| **Compliance** | License and regulatory | Service compliance |

### How They Work Together

- **ITAM** provides financial and lifecycle management
- **ITIL CM** provides service delivery support
- **Integration** enables comprehensive IT management
- **Shared Data** improves accuracy and reduces duplication
