## Core ITAM Principles

### 1. Lifecycle Management

**Principle:** Manage assets throughout their complete lifecycle.

**Key Points:**
- Assets have a lifecycle from procurement to retirement

- Optimize asset utilization at each stage

### 2. Accurate Data

**Principle:** Maintain accurate and up-to-date asset data.

**Key Points:**
- Accurate data is essential for ITAM success
- Data accuracy requires continuous effort
- Automated discovery improves accuracy
- Regular reconciliation maintains accuracy

**Application:**
- Use automated discovery tools
- Conduct regular audits
- Reconcile data from multiple sources
- Establish data quality metrics

### 3. Compliance First

**Principle:** Ensure compliance with licenses and regulations.

**Key Points:**
- Compliance is a critical ITAM objective
- License violations can be costly
- Regulatory compliance is mandatory
- Proactive compliance is better than reactive

**Application:**
- Track all software licenses
- Monitor license usage
- Prepare for audits
- Establish compliance processes

### 4. Cost Optimization

**Principle:** Optimize IT spending and maximize ROI.
