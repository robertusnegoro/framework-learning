## Asset Categorization Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Classification

- Use standard categories
- Define classification rules
- Train staff on classification
- Review classifications regularly

### 2. Hierarchical Structure

- Use parent-child relationships
- Group related assets
- Enable drill-down reporting
- Support multiple views

### 3. Metadata and Tags

- Add metadata to assets
- Use tags for classification
- Enable search and filtering
- Support reporting

### 4. Regular Review

- Review classifications
- Update as needed
- Maintain accuracy
- Align with business needs

## Special Considerations

### Hybrid Assets

Some assets span multiple categories:
- **Virtual Machines:** Hardware (host) + Software (VM)
- **Cloud Hardware:** Cloud (service) + Hardware (underlying)
- **Software Appliances:** Software + Hardware (embedded)

### Asset Relationships

Assets often have relationships:
- **Dependencies:** Software depends on hardware
- **Bundles:** Software bundled with hardware
- **Suites:** Multiple software products together
- **Infrastructure:** Supporting assets
