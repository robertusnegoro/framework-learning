## Key Concepts

### Asset vs Configuration Item

**Asset:** An IT asset is any hardware, software, or cloud resource that has financial value and is managed throughout its lifecycle.

**Configuration Item (CI):** A CI is any component that needs to be managed to deliver an IT service. Assets can be CIs, but not all CIs are assets.

### Asset Lifecycle

The complete lifecycle of an IT asset:
- **Plan:** Strategic planning and requirements definition
- **Acquire:** Procurement, purchase, or lease
- **Deploy:** Installation, configuration, and activation
- **Manage:** Ongoing operations, maintenance, and optimization
- **Retire:** Decommissioning, disposal, and replacement

### Discovery

The process of identifying and cataloging IT assets:
- **Automated Discovery:** Using tools to scan networks
- **Manual Discovery:** Physical inventory and documentation
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combining automated and manual methods

### Compliance

Ensuring adherence to:
- **License Compliance:** Software license agreements
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Industry and government regulations
- **Contract Compliance:** Vendor and supplier agreements

## ITAM vs ITIL Configuration Management

| Aspect | ITAM | ITIL Configuration Management |
|--------|------|------------------------------|
| **Focus** | Financial and lifecycle | Service delivery |
| **Scope** | All IT assets | Service-related CIs |
| **Primary Goal** | Cost optimization, compliance | Service support |
| **Lifecycle** | Plan to Retire | Service lifecycle |
| **Financial** | Strong focus | Limited focus |

**They Complement Each Other:**
- ITAM: Manages assets for financial and compliance purposes
- ITIL CM: Manages CIs for service delivery purposes
