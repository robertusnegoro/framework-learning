## What are Guiding Principles?

**Guiding Principles** are recommendations that guide organizations in all circumstances, regardless of changes in goals, strategies, type of work, or management structure.

### Key Characteristics

- **Universal:** Apply to all situations
- **Enduring:** Remain valid over time
- **Practical:** Provide actionable guidance
- **Flexible:** Adaptable to context

---

## The Seven Guiding Principles

### 1. Focus on Value

**Definition:**  
Everything the organization does should link back, directly or indirectly, to value for stakeholders.

**Key Points:**
- Understand what stakeholders value
- Everything should create value
- Value is co-created
- Measure value delivered

**How to Apply:**
- Understand stakeholder needs
- Define value clearly
- Measure value delivered
- Prioritize value-creating activities

**Example:**  
Instead of implementing a new feature because it's "cool," implement it because it creates value for customers (improves productivity, reduces costs, etc.).

**Questions to Ask:**
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What do they value?
- How does this create value?
- How do we measure value?

### 2. Start Where You Are

**Definition:**  
Do not start from scratch and build something new without considering what is already available.

**Key Points:**
- Assess current state
- Build on existing capabilities
- Don't discard what works
- Reuse and adapt

**How to Apply:**
- Assess current capabilities
- Identify what works
- Build on strengths
- Reuse existing resources

**Example:**  
Instead of replacing an entire system, assess what works, keep the good parts, and improve the weak parts.

**Questions to Ask:**
- What do we have now?
- What works well?
- What can we reuse?
- What needs improvement?

### 3. Progress Iteratively with Feedback

**Definition:**  
Do not attempt to do everything at once. Work in an iterative way with feedback loops.

**Key Points:**
- Make small, incremental improvements
- Gather feedback continuously
- Adjust based on feedback
- Learn and adapt

**How to Apply:**
- Break work into small increments
- Implement incrementally
- Gather feedback
- Adjust and improve

**Example:**  
Instead of implementing a complete new process at once, implement it in phases, gather feedback after each phase, and adjust.

**Questions to Ask:**
- How can we break this into smaller pieces?
- What feedback do we need?
- How do we gather feedback?
- How do we adjust based on feedback?

---

### 4. Collaborate and Promote Visibility

**Definition:**  
Work together across boundaries to produce results that have greater value.

**Key Points:**
- Work together
- Share information
- Break down silos
- Promote transparency

**How to Apply:**
- Involve stakeholders
- Share information openly
- Work across teams
- Make work visible

**Example:**  
Instead of IT working in isolation, collaborate with business units, share information, and make work visible through dashboards and reports.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Who should be involved?
- What information should be shared?
- How do we break down silos?
- How do we make work visible?

---

### 5. Think and Work Holistically

**Definition:**  
No service, practice, process, department, or supplier stands alone.

**Key Points:**
- Consider the whole system
- Understand relationships
- Avoid optimizing parts at expense of whole
- See the big picture

**How to Apply:**
- Consider all components
- Understand dependencies
- Think system-wide
- Avoid local optimization

**Example:**  
Instead of optimizing incident resolution time alone, consider how it affects problem management, change management, and customer satisfaction holistically.

**Questions to Ask:**
- What are all the components?
- How do they relate?
- What are the dependencies?
- What's the big picture?

---

### 6. Keep It Simple and Practical

**Definition:**  
Use the minimum number of steps necessary to accomplish an objective.

**Key Points:**
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Use simplest approach that works
- Focus on what matters
- Remove unnecessary steps

**How to Apply:**
- Simplify processes
- Remove unnecessary steps
- Focus on essentials
- Avoid over-engineering

**Example:**  
Instead of a complex 10-step approval process, use a simple 3-step process that achieves the same result.

**Questions to Ask:**
- What's the simplest way?
- What steps are necessary?
- What can we remove?
- What's practical?

---

### 7. Optimize and Automate

**Definition:**  
Resources of all types should be used to their best effect. Eliminate anything that is truly wasteful and use technology to achieve whatever it is capable of.

**Key Points:**
- Optimize resources
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Eliminate waste
- Use technology effectively

**How to Apply:**
- Identify waste
- Optimize processes
- Automate where possible
- Use technology effectively

**Example:**  
Instead of manual password resets, automate them through self-service portal, freeing staff for higher-value work.

**Questions to Ask:**
- What can we optimize?
- What can we automate?
- What's wasteful?
- How can technology help?

## How Principles Work Together

### Principles Are Interrelated

Principles work together and support each other:

- **Focus on Value** guides what to optimize
- **Start Where You Are** prevents waste
- **Progress Iteratively** enables learning
- **Collaborate** improves outcomes
- **Think Holistically** prevents sub-optimization
- **Keep It Simple** reduces waste
- **Optimize and Automate** improves efficiency

### Example: Implementing a New Process

1. **Focus on Value:** Understand what value this creates
2. **Start Where You Are:** Assess current process
3. **Progress Iteratively:** Implement in phases
4. **Collaborate:** Involve stakeholders
5. **Think Holistically:** Consider all impacts
6. **Keep It Simple:** Use simplest approach
7. **Optimize and Automate:** Optimize and automate where possible

---

## Applying Principles

### All Principles Apply Always

All seven principles should be considered in every situation, though some may be more relevant than others.

### Context Matters

The application of principles depends on context:
- Organization size
- Industry
- Maturity level
- Culture

### Balance

Sometimes principles may seem to conflict - balance is key:
- **Simple vs Comprehensive:** Keep it simple but comprehensive enough
- **Iterative vs Complete:** Progress iteratively but deliver complete value
- **Optimize vs Flexible:** Optimize but remain flexible
