## Learning Objectives

By the end of this document, you should understand:
- What the Service Value Chain is
- The six activities of the Service Value Chain
- How activities work together
- How to create value streams
- How activities relate to practices

## What is the Service Value Chain?

The **Service Value Chain** is a flexible operating model with six activities that can be combined in different ways to create value streams. It is the core of the Service Value System.

### Key Characteristics

- **Flexible:** Activities can be combined in different ways
- **Universal:** Applies to all services and value streams
- **Activity-Based:** Focuses on what needs to be done
- **Value-Focused:** All activities create value

## How Activities Work Together

### Value Streams

**Value Stream:** A series of steps an organization takes to create and deliver value.

**Activities can be combined** in different ways to create value streams for different scenarios.

### Example Value Stream: New Service Request

1. **Engage:** Understand customer requirements
2. **Plan:** Plan service delivery
3. **Design & Transition:** Design the service
4. **Obtain/Build:** Acquire or build components
5. **Deliver & Support:** Deliver and support the service
6. **Improve:** Continuously improve the service

### Example Value Stream: Incident Resolution

1. **Engage:** Communicate with user
2. **Obtain/Build:** Get information/resources
3. **Deliver & Support:** Resolve incident
4. **Improve:** Learn from incident

### Example Value Stream: Change Implementation

1. **Plan:** Plan the change
2. **Engage:** Coordinate stakeholders
3. **Design & Transition:** Design change
4. **Obtain/Build:** Build change
5. **Deliver & Support:** Implement and support
6. **Improve:** Review and improve

---

## Activity Relationships

### All Activities Can Connect

Activities are not sequential - they can connect in any order as needed for the value stream.

### Common Patterns

- **Plan → Design & Transition → Obtain/Build → Deliver & Support**
- **Engage → Plan → Design & Transition**
- **Deliver & Support → Improve**
- **Improve → Plan → Design & Transition**

### Improve Activity

**Improve** can connect to any other activity:
- Improve → Plan (improve planning)
- Improve → Design & Transition (improve design)
- Improve → Deliver & Support (improve delivery)
