## What are the Four Dimensions?

The **Four Dimensions** provide a holistic view of service management. They ensure that all aspects of service management are considered.

### Why Four Dimensions?

Service management is complex and involves many aspects. The four dimensions ensure nothing is overlooked.

### Key Principle

**All four dimensions must be considered** when designing, delivering, and improving services. Ignoring any dimension can lead to failure.

## How Dimensions Work Together

### All Dimensions Are Required

All four dimensions must be considered together. They are interdependent:

- **Organizations & People** need **Information & Technology** to work effectively
- **Value Streams & Processes** require **Organizations & People** to execute
- **Partners & Suppliers** provide **Information & Technology**
- **Value Streams & Processes** integrate with **Partners & Suppliers**

### Example: Implementing a New Service

1. **Organizations & People:** Define roles, train staff, establish culture
2. **Information & Technology:** Implement systems, manage data, ensure security
3. **Partners & Suppliers:** Engage suppliers, establish contracts, integrate systems
4. **Value Streams & Processes:** Define processes, create value streams, optimize workflows

All four dimensions must be addressed for success.

## Applying the Four Dimensions

### When Designing Services

Consider all four dimensions:
- What people and organization are needed?
- What information and technology are required?
- What partners and suppliers are involved?
- What value streams and processes are needed?

### When Improving Services

Assess all four dimensions:
- Are people and organization adequate?
- Is information and technology sufficient?
- Are partners and suppliers effective?
- Are value streams and processes efficient?

### When Troubleshooting

Check all four dimensions:
- People/organization issues?
- Information/technology problems?
- Partner/supplier issues?
- Process/value stream problems?
