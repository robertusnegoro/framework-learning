**Synergy:**
- **COBIT** establishes governance objectives and control requirements
- **TOGAF** designs the enterprise architecture that realizes governance objectives
- **ITIL 4** provides standardized practices to manage services running on that architecture
- **ITSM** operationalizes ITIL practices in day-to-day operations
- **FinOps** optimizes cloud costs within the technology architecture

**Example Integration:**
- COBIT defines "Align, Plan & Organize" objectives for change management
- ITIL 4 provides the Change Enablement practice with detailed guidance
- ITSM implements the practice through tools, processes, and people
