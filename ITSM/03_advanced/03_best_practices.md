## Process Best Practices

### Incident Management Best Practices

1. **Single Point of Contact**
   - Service Desk as single point
   - Consistent experience
   - Better tracking

2. **Quick Categorization**
   - Categorize quickly
   - Use standard categories
   - Enable routing

3. **Effective Prioritization**
   - Use impact and urgency
   - Prioritize consistently
   - Focus on high priority

4. **Knowledge Base**
   - Maintain knowledge base
   - Use for resolution
   - Update regularly

5. **Communication**
   - Communicate regularly
   - Set expectations
   - Update status

**Example:** Service Desk receives incident → Categorizes quickly → Prioritizes based on impact/urgency → Uses knowledge base → Communicates status → Resolves quickly.

### Problem Management Best Practices

1. **Proactive Approach**
   - Don't wait for incidents
   - Analyze trends
   - Prevent problems

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Find root causes

   - Document workarounds
   - Share knowledge

4. **Collaboration**
   - Work with teams
   - Share information
   - Learn together

5. **Follow-Up**
   - Verify fixes work
   - Monitor for recurrence
   - Close problems properly

**Example:** Analyze incident trends → Identify problem → Root cause analysis → Find root cause → Develop fix → Test → Deploy → Verify → Close.

### Change Management Best Practices

1. **Risk-Based Approach**
   - Assess risk
   - Focus on high-risk changes
   - Standardize low-risk

2. **Clear Process**
   - Well-defined process
   - Clear roles

5. **Post-Implementation Review**
   - Review all changes
   - Learn from failures
   - Improve process

**Example:** Change request → Risk assessment → CAB review → Approval → Testing → Implementation → Review → Close.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Tool-First Approach

**Problem:** Selecting tool before defining processes.

**Solution:** Define processes first, then select tool.

### Pitfall 2: Over-Engineering

**Problem:** Creating overly complex processes.

**Solution:** Keep it simple, focus on value.

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring People

**Problem:** Focusing on process/tool, ignoring people.

**Solution:** Involve people, provide training, address concerns.

### Pitfall 4: No Measurement

**Problem:** Not measuring performance.

**Solution:** Define metrics, measure regularly, use for improvement.

### Pitfall 5: Set and Forget

**Problem:** Implementing and not improving.

**Solution:** Continuous improvement, regular reviews, adapt to changes.

### Pitfall 6: Silos

**Problem:** Processes don't integrate.

**Solution:** Think holistically, integrate processes, share information.

### Pitfall 7: No Business Alignment

**Problem:** ITSM not aligned with business.

**Solution:** Understand business needs, align processes, demonstrate value.
