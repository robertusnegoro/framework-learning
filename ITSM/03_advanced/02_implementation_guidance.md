- Manageable
- Learn and adjust
- Less disruptive

**Cons:**
- Takes longer
- May have gaps
- Requires discipline

**When to Use:**
- Most organizations
- Complex environments

- Need for stability

### Pilot Approach

**Description:** Start with pilot, then expand.

**Pros:**
- Low risk
- Learn before full rollout
- Build confidence
- Prove value

**Cons:**
- Takes time
- May not scale
- Requires resources for pilot

**When to Use:**
- Large organizations
- Uncertain environment
- Need to prove value
- Complex implementations

- Documentation

**Example:** Design incident management process → Define roles → Select tool → Define metrics.

### Phase 3: Implementation

**Purpose:** Implement processes and systems.

**Activities:**
- Implement processes
- Deploy tools
- Train staff
- Communicate changes
- Execute pilot (if applicable)

**Deliverables:**
- Implemented processes
- Deployed tools
- Trained staff
- Communication materials
- Pilot results

**Example:** Implement incident process → Deploy ServiceNow → Train service desk → Communicate changes.

### Phase 4: Operation

**Purpose:** Operate new processes and systems.

**Activities:**
- Execute processes
- Monitor performance
- Handle issues
- Gather feedback
- Make adjustments

**Deliverables:**
- Operating processes
- Performance reports
- Issue logs
- Feedback reports
- Adjustments

**Example:** Operate incident process → Monitor performance → Handle issues → Gather feedback.

### Phase 5: Improvement

**Purpose:** Continuously improve.

**Activities:**
- Measure performance
- Identify improvements
- Implement improvements
- Review results
- Share lessons learned

**Deliverables:**
- Performance metrics
- Improvement plans
- Implemented improvements
- Review reports
- Lessons learned

**Example:** Measure incident resolution time → Identify improvements → Implement → Review results.
