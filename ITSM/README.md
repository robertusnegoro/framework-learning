## Overview

IT Service Management (ITSM) is the practice of designing, implementing, managing, and improving IT services to meet business needs. ITSM focuses on aligning IT services with business objectives and ensuring efficient, effective service delivery.

---

## What is ITSM?

ITSM is not a framework itself, but rather a **discipline** or **practice** that uses frameworks (like ITIL) to manage IT services throughout their lifecycle. ITSM encompasses:

- **Service Strategy:** Understanding business needs and planning IT services
- **Service Design:** Designing services to meet requirements
- **Service Transition:** Moving services from design to operation
- **Service Operation:** Day-to-day management of services
- **Continual Service Improvement:** Ongoing optimization and enhancement

## Key Concepts

### Service
A means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes they want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs and risks.

### Service Lifecycle
The five stages that services go through:
1. **Service Strategy** - Understanding market and customer needs
2. **Service Design** - Designing services and processes
3. **Service Transition** - Building and deploying services
4. **Service Operation** - Running services day-to-day
5. **Continual Service Improvement** - Improving services continuously

### Process vs Function
- **Process:** A structured set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective
- **Function:** A team or group of people with specific responsibilities

## ITSM vs ITIL

**ITSM** is the practice/discipline of managing IT services.  
**ITIL** is a framework that provides best practices for ITSM.

Think of it this way:
- ITSM = What you do (the practice)
- ITIL = How to do it (the framework)
